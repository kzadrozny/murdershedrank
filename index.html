      <h2>Halloween Special: Oct 30th</h2>
      <h3>Friday, 8pm Central / 6pm Pacific</h3>
      <p>We are doing our annual Halloween Special of watching three episodes of <em>Supernatural</em>.<br/>
        Join us for some silliness and <a href="pdfs/supernatural_bingo.pdf">special bingo cards</a> just for the occasion.</p>
      <h3>Episodes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bloody Mary (1.5)</li>
          <li>Ghostfacers (3.13)</li>
          <li><strong>Patreon votes to choose between:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Hammer of the Gods (5.19)</li>
              <li>French Mistake (6.15)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Shelter in Place Variation</h2>
      <p>During shelter-in-place we will be meeting weekly! On the Fridays between the "proper" #MuderSheDrank we will gather to watch a different show. Same time as usual; please check <strong>#HyggeLypse</strong> on <a href="https://twitter.com/MurderSheDrank">Twitter</a> for the episodes we are watching.</p>
      <h3>August-Sept: <em>The 100</em></h3>
      <p><strong>Using #HyggeLypse on social media; Streaming on Netflix</strong><br/>
      Heck of a tonal shift, we understand. We just figure if we are living in an apocolypse, might as well watch one that is being handled better than ours is. Plus, it has a strong female lead, murder, and poor fashion choices, just like <em>Murder She Wrote</em></p>

      <h3>March-July: <em>Rosemary &amp; Thyme</em></h3>
      <p><strong>Used #MurderSheDrank on social media; Streaming on BritBox and YouTube</strong><br/>
      What isn't there to love about cheeky drunk gardeners literally tripping over dead bodies?<br/>If you missed this when we were doing this, please don't let that stop you from participating! We've left the bingo cards available for you to party on your own time.</p> -->

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">How do I play?</h3>
      <p>Easily, you don't even need to play along with us; you can do it on your own time.
        <ol>
          <li>Download and print the Bingo Cards.</li>
          <li>Start an episode of Murder She Wrote.</li>
          <li>Mark a bingo square when the event happens in the episode.</li>
          <li>When you get 5 in a row you win MSD Bingo and earn insane bragging rights.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need to use a new bingo card for each episode?</h3>
      <p>No, that would make bingo very hard. Continue using the bingo card you chose if you watch more than one episode. It normally takes two episodes to get close to winning.</p>

      <h3>Are the episodes streaming anywhere?</h3>
      <p>Yes! All seasons are available on the Peacock app and Roku. Seasons 1-5 are streaming on Amazon Prime in the U.S. Canada has all seasons available through Amazon Prime.</p>

      <h3>Do I need to drink to participate?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely not. In fact, half of Murder HQ are sober folks. "Murder She Drank" just sounded hilarious to us and we had to run with it. We do encourage crappy jokes and snacking though.</p>

      <h3>Is this a regular thing?</h3>
      <p>Indeed, we've been doing this since 2014. We normally meet at 8pm Central on the third Friday of the month, but double check as this sometimes changes. We are currently working our way through season 9.</p>

      <h3>Who are the "murder buddies"?</h3>
      <p>We refer to the folks who join us during the live tweet of Murder She Drank as "murder buddies." If you have ever joined us for a live watch and tweet, you are part of the murder buddy crew. We think you are awesome.</p>

      <h3>How do you divide the seasons/episodes?</h3>
      <p>After some trial and error we decided to do one season per year. We plot the episodes so that we do two episodes a month and there are normally 22 episodes in a season. This normally leaves us with one month where we technically have no episodes to watch. Some years we do a special "Halloween" edition where we watch a different show (*cough*<em>Supernatural</em>*cough*) and other years we decide to take a break in December so we can relax and refresh for the new year. We always announce what our plans are toward the end of the year, so keep an eye out.</p>

      <h3>Why do your bingo cards start with "set 3"?</h3>
      <p>We periodically created new bingo cards as we get on in the series. Sets 1-2 were very hard because they were specific to certain episodes. The earlier cards were based on a <a href="http://bonniegrrl.livejournal.com/805942.html">drinking game</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/bonniegrrl">Bonnie Burton</a>. As we got on in the series we ended-up expanding the bingo squares to more open tropes of the show as well as common things that we saw happen within the Twitter community. Since we've made the change folks are actually able to win bingo, which is a mighty great feeling.</p>

      <h3>What is the Discord used for?</h3>
      <p>We started the <a href="https://discord.gg/rpm69JA6Bf">Discord server</a> as a back-up in case Twitter went down / goes down. We have started using it as a space for sub-groups of the Murder Buddies to gather, such as for book clubs. Patreons also have their own channel in the server.</p>
